    //Could possibly make this a Week class instead, and have days be an array or Map of 'day' objects. Depending on if it's
    // 3-6 days a week it would fill the week with the day objects and then distribute the exercises/reps/weight based on
    // some sort of formula. Like if day 1 is heavy/high volume, day 2 will adjust to be easier. If the week is a deload-type
    // then the overall volume/weight will be less.
